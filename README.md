# EAGER-GUI
This is the main project for the EAGER project, with links to some tutorials, subsequent tools and HowTos and a FAQ which will be updated once we get feedback from end users. Please use the different bug trackers for other tools than the actual pipeline, e.g. the Clip&Merge issue tracking if you encounter issues with the Clip&Merge application.
