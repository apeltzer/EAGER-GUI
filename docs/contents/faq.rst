I am missing Feature X for my analysis
--------------------------------------

You can either contact Alexander Peltzer <alexander.peltzer@uni-tuebingen.de> directly or open a `ticket <https://github.com/apeltzer/EAGER-GUI/issues>`_ on Github directly, describing what you would like to see in the pipeline. We can not make promises to fullfill all the questions you might ask for but are constantly looking for feedback to improve the usability of EAGER and provide more features for users.
