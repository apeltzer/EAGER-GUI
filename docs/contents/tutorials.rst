This section describes several potential use cases for EAGER. A complete analysis of a couple of mitochondrial captures, a bacterial genome analysis and a analysis of human whole genome shotgun data.

Mitochondrial analysis
----------------------

First, we will have to make sure that all data that we are using is there. This consists of three samples (Sample A-C) that have been created using a paired-end sequencing run on an Illumina sequencer. In order to run the analysis, we will utilize the EAGER pipeline and configure it step-by-step to run our analysis.

Step I: Data preparation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You should have a couple of folders set up, mainly containing the data, making sure the data follows the guidelines for :ref:`naming_scheme` .


Bacterial analysis
------------------


Human (WGS) analysis
--------------------
